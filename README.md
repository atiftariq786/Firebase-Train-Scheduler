## Train Schedular Descriptions
* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination 
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes
* The next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

## Chalenging Point
*  Interface with data base little consume time but fixed interface problems.
*  Submit button function give little hard time.
*  Time conversion, work with frequency and awaytime setting give little stuck me but google flu is    our friend, So using momentjs every stuck things like time,frequency related problems fixed.
